Utilizing the data provided by Department of Education on the NYC Open Data website and p5.js, this website visualizes selected information in a more engaging way, making the experiecne of looking through this data more &#10024;.

        <h1>about this dataset &#128678;</h1>
        <p>
          The data used in this project is from NYC Open Data <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays/ez4e-fazm">Bus Breakdown and Delays</a>.
          <br><br>
          This system collects information from school bus vendors operating out in the field in real time. Bus staff that encounter delays during the route are instructed to radio the dispatcher at the bus vendorâ€™s central office. The bus vendor staff are then instructed to log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay system to record the event and notify OPT. OPT customer service agents use this system to inform parents who call with questions regarding bus service. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system is publicly accessible and contains real time updates. All information in the system is entered by school bus vendor staff.

            <li>the circles on the screen are generated according to the reasons for delay/breakdown, so depending on how often buses are delay/breakdown, the size of each circle will change.</li>
            <li>when the user hovers over the circle, it will stop spinning&#8263;&#8263;&#8263; - need to see if this can be executed on p5.js</li>

                <p>I created a motion graphic for Constantin and Laurene Leon Boym's "Manifesto #16: Designer as Curious George" from the design manifestos collection. This manifesto resonated with me because it uses the character Curious George to illustrate how designers should always be driven to play, experiment, and embrace failure as a learning experience.</p>

                <p>Mainly inspired by Camille Utterback’s installations, in which she uses different texts, icons, images, etc., to create abstract symbolic systems, as well as our relationship with interfaces and symbolic systems of the machines, I recreated her installation, Visual Resolve, 2000, an abstracted version of the participants created on the screen, where she explores the levels of the icons and the overall image. This project connects to the MAGNIFICATION project, and exploring how magnification can be experimented with and how it challenges our visual perception in a digital space.

                <p>YOKKAO's Muay Thai hand wraps feature typography and icon, providing a balance of detail for animation. I created a 15-second animation using After Effects that reveals the visual elements of the hand wraps' design. I carefully planned the sequence and timing, determining the order in which elements appear, placing them on the screen to ensure a cohesive final image. To enhance the animation, I incorporated sound effects, making it more engaging and dynamic. Throughout the process, I tried to maintain the spirit of the original hand wraps and the sport while creating a visually compelling piece.</p>

                <p>This project explores designing a camera to capture specific subjects—whether a person, place, or object.

                <p>In this project, the class collaboratively created a "music video" using the given music piece by combining shapes and movement techniques to illustrate synesthesia and cause and effect. I aimed to align the visuals with the music, considering composition, sequence, and color palettes. Each student animated an assigned music segment and also created the opening title and closing credits for the class compilation using After Effects. The goal is to understand how sound guides the movement and behavior of objects, using simple shapes and colors to enhance the music's rhythms and dynamics.</p>

                <p>This project explores how time-based presentation can transform a simple typographic message, examining the interplay between form and content in motion. By animating the headline of the article "Long Live the Chicago Rat Hole" from The Atlantic, I looked the effects of size, placement, composition, sound, speed, pauses, repetition, spacing, and color on the message over time. How does the headline change as it moves across a timeline? How does animation reflect the article's content or convey an opinion? This project aims to reveal the dynamic potential of headlines through motion.</p>

                <p>It is about the underlying relationships and the narratives, how each small, simple thing can develop and expand to become a part of an interesting story and add to a more vibrant whole. So a lot of things in our environment contributes to creating a narrative, enhancing an experience, and ultimately, making something better.</p>

                    Any time you see a multiplicity of an object, you begin to notice similarities and contexts in a new way. Seeing multiple of an object allows for this kind of in depth research that observing one object does not. The way the object is documented and organized helps direct the viewer on how the object is meant to be experienced.

                    This project investigates the themes of privacy through people-watching. The aim of this project is to gather and organize a collection of data, understand metadata, to tell a story through content curation and order, to experiment with interactions with a collection, and to develop a working relationship of JavaScript objects and data collections.

            <p>love story is a short film about the relationship between GIRL 1 and GIRL 2 (played by Aviela Berk & Sade Ajas) and how it turns out to be not as romantic as you might think. The art film experiments with the archetypes of psychological horror films and attempts to break the stereotypical “look” and “plot” while still aiming to leave the audience unsettled afterwards.</p>

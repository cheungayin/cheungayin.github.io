            We’ve all seen tiny boats inside tiny glass bottles, and miniature sculptures the size of a pinhead. But what about when art gets down to a cellular scale? The art of arranging microscopic algae-type organisms into patterns has been practiced by scientists since the Victorian era. But it largely died down after the 19th century, with most arrangers taking their secrets to the grave. However that hasn’t stopped one UK-based scientist from carrying on the tradition.
            <br><br>
            Called diatoms, these beautiful single-celled phytoplankton are the lowest stage of the food chain, producing nutrition from light. But unlike their mossy green compatriots, diatoms are unique as they are surrounded in a layer of silica, allowing them to form beautiful, diverse shapes and colours. Klaus Kemp, a microscopist in East Brent, knows this all too well as he has devoted much of his life to studying and arranging the microorganisms in a dizzying array of kaleidoscopic patterns. “As a youngster of 16 I had a great passion for natural history and came across a collection of sample tubes of diatoms from the Victorian era,” Klaus told Wired.co.uk. “I was immediately struck by the beauty and symmetry of diatoms. The symmetry and sculpturing on an organism that one cannot see with the naked eye astonished me, and after 60 years of following this passion I can still get excited from the next sample I receive or collect.”
            <br><br>
            Klaus is inspired by the original diatomists from the Victorian era whose works are well sought-after by collectors. Names such as Johann Diedrich Möller and R. I. Firth have inspired him so much that Klaus is planning to recreate some of their original exhibition slides himself. Finding those initial tubes while working for a Manchester biological supply company was just the first step of Klaus’ adventure in microscopy. He has since collected thousands of samples from many different sites, with each location having its own specific type or structure of diatom.
            <br><br>
            “Diatoms are very varied and yes one can generally place roughly where they have been collected, just as one can determine by the plants in a garden or field whether you are in an alkaline or acid area,” Klaus tells us. “Diatoms have much the same preferences and those that thrive in the ocean do not survive in freshwater and vice versa. Diatoms are quite often used to determine the purity or quality of a stream, pond or beach, by which species are present, as each location will support those that are best adapted for that environment.”
            <br><br>
            The role diatoms play in the environment can’t be understated.
            As well as being a potent indicator of water purity or environmental pollution, they also form the base of much of our ecosystem. Due to their photosynthetic action in every environment that contains water (from oceans, to streams, to damp soil) diatoms are one of the main exporters of carbon from the ocean. They do this through virtue of a bloom and bust cycle of thriving in perfect conditions and dying off once population saturation is reached.
            <br><br>
            This isn’t so much of a problem for Klaus though, as diatoms hang around for a long while. “Being made up of Silica it means they do not rot away over long periods of dying and settling as a sediment creates a layer of silica called Diatomaceus earth,” Klaus said. “The UK has just two major deposits of diatoms, one is on the Island of Skye and the other is in Kentmere, but to date only one site is worked commercially, in Toome Bridge in Northern Ireland.”
            <br><br>
            Klaus has become such a renowned figure in this field that his art has also been captured in a documentary by Matt Killip. In it, Killip proposes that Klaus is the last great practitioner of this beautiful combination of art and science. It’s not all about the beauty of the art he produces from this pursuit, as Klaus also contributes academically in his chosen field. “In making the exhibition slides I search a large number of what we call strew slides [a drop of mixed diatoms] and just now and again one finds a new species to science, which is naturally very rewarding.”

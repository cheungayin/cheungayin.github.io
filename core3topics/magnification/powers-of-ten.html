                The picnic near the lake side in Chicago is the start of a lazy afternoon early one October.
                <br><br>
                We begin with a scene one meter wide, which we view from just one meter away. Now every ten seconds we will look from ten times farther away, and our field of view will be ten times wider. This square is ten meters wide and in ten seconds the next square will be ten times as wide. Our picture will center on the picnickers. Even after they’ve been lost to sight.
            </p>

            <p id="makeTextBigger">
            <!-- <p class="bigger-font"> -->
                One hundred meters wide.
                <br><br>
                The distance a man can run in ten seconds, cars crowd the highway, powerboats lie at their docks, the colorful bleachers are soldiers field. This square is kilometer a wide, one thousand meters, the distance a racing car can travel in ten seconds. We see the great city on the lake shore.
                <br><br>
                Ten to the fourth meters, ten kilometers, the distance a supersonic airplane can travel in ten seconds, we see first the rounded end of lake Michigan, then the whole great lake, ten to the fifth meters, the distance of orbiting satellite covers in ten seconds. Long parades of clouds, the day’s weather in the middle west.
                <br><br>
                Ten to the sixth, a one with six zeros, a million meters, soon the earth will show as a solid sphere.
                <br><br>
                We are able to see the whole earth now, just over a minute along the journey. The Earth diminishes into the distance, but those background stars are so much farther away, they do not yet appear to move. A line extends at the true speed of light, in one second it half crosses the tilted orbit of the moon.
                <br><br>
                Now we mark a small part of the path in which the earth moves about the sun. Now the orbital paths of the neighbor planets, Venus, and Mars, then Mercury, entering our field of view is the glowing center of our solar system, the Sun. Followed by the massive outer planets, swinging wide in their big orbits. That odd orbit belongs to Pluto, a fringe in the myriad comets too faint to see completes the solar system.
                <br><br>
                Ten to the fourteenth. As the solar system shrinks to one bright point in the distance, our Sun is plainly now only one among the stars. Looking back from here we note four southern constellation still much as they appear, from the far side of the earth.
                <br><br>
                This square’s ten to the sixteenth meters, one light year, not yet out to the next star. Our last ten second step took us ten light years further the next will be one hundred. Our perspective changes so much in each step now that even the background stars will appear to converge. At last we pass the bright star Arcturus and some stars of the dipper. Normal but quite unfamiliar stars and clouds of gas surround us as we traverse the milky way galaxy.
                <br><br>
                Giant steps carry us into the outskirts of the galaxy, and as we pull away we begin to see the great flat spiral facing us. The time and path we chose to leave Chicago has brought us out of the galaxy along a course nearly perpendicular to its disk.
                <br><br>
                The two little satellite galaxies of our own are the clouds of Magellan. Ten to the twenty second power, a million light years.
                <br><br>
                Groups of galaxies bring a new level of structure to the scene. Glowing point are no longer single stars, but whole galaxy of stars seen as one.
                <br><br>
                We passed the big Virgo cluster of galaxies among many others. A hundred million light years out. As we approach the limit of our vision, we pause to start back home. This lonely scene the galaxies like dust is what most of space looks like. This emptiness is normal. The richness of our own neighborhood is the exception.
                <br><br>
                The trip back to the picnic on the lakefront will be a sped-up version, reducing the distance to the earth’s surface by one power of ten every two seconds. In each two seconds we will appear to cover 90% the remaining distance back to earth. Notice the alternation between great activity and relative inactivity, a rhythm that will continue all the way into our next goal a proton in the nucleus of a carbon atom beneath the skin on the hand of the sleeping man at the picnic.
                <br><br>
                Ten to the ninth meters, ten to the eighth, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We are back at our starting point, we slow up at one meter, ten to the zero power.
            </p>
        
            <p id="makeTextSmaller">
            <!-- <p class="smaller-font"> -->
                Now we reduce the distance to our final destination by ninety percent every ten seconds.
                <br><br>
                Each step much smaller than the one before.
                <br><br>
                At ten to the minus two, one one hundredth of a meter, one centimeter we approach the surface of the hand.
                <br><br>
                In a few seconds with the entering the skin, crossing layer after layer from the outermost dead cells into a tiny blood vessel within. Skin layers vanish in turn. An outer layer of cells, felty collagen, the capillary containing red blood cells and a ruffly lymphocyte. We enter the white cell, among it’s vital organelles the porous wall of the cell nucleus appears. The nucleus within holds the heredity of the man in the coiled coils of DNA. As we close in we come to the double helix itself. A molecule like a long twisted ladder who’s rungs of paired basis spell out twice, in an alphabet of four letters, words of a powerful genetic message. At the atomic scale, the interplay of form and motion becomes more visible. We focus on one commonplace group of three hydrogen atoms bonded by electrical forces to a carbon atom. Four electrons makeup the outer shell of the carbon itself, they appear in quantum motion s a swarm of shimmering points.
                <br><br>
                At ten to the minus ten meters, one angstrom, we find ourselves right among those outer electrons. Now we come upon the two inner electrons held in a tighter swarm. As we draw toward the atoms attracting center we enter upon a vast interspace.
                <br><br>
                At last the carbon nucleus. So massive and so small. This carbon nucleus is made up of six protons and six neutrons. We are in the domain of universal modules. There are protons and neutrons in every nucleus, electrons in every atom. Atoms bonded into every molecule out to the farthest galaxy. As a single proton fills our scene, we reached the edge of present understanding.
                <br><br>
                Are these some quarks that intense interaction?
                <br><br>
                Our journey has taken us through forty powers of ten. If now the field is one unit, then when we saw many clusters of galaxies together it was ten to the fortieth, or one and forty zeroes.

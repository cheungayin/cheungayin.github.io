                    Brief: <br>
                    Design a typographic poster for an event or purpose of your choosing.

                    I chose to create a poster to promote a noodle shop. The restaurant I have chosen to base it on is TamJai SamGor MiXian, a fast casual restaurant chain in Hong Kong with operations in Singapore and Japan. They currently do not have a store open  in New York City so this was created as a pretend promotional poster/material for them.
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to experiment with creating my own Chinese character for this poster. It was important for me to include Chinese typography while desgining this as it shows the Chinese culture as well as the culture behind the restaurant.

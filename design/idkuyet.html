                    Designing this card game has offered a bridge between my research from Bridge 3 which investigates artist Gauri Gill’s Acts of Appearance (a series of photographs following the intricacies and complications of identity and cultural heterogeneity of an indigenous community in present-day Maharashtra, India), and my explorations on identity and the idea of hiding behind a mask. We put on a “mask” to seem different as adults over and over again, and we often wonder why we do. It is important to have the guts to be vulnerable and honest in order to help us appreciate the value and significance of taking off the mask. By creating I DON’T KNOW YOU (YET), an interactive card game with three levels of questions and wildcards, I hope to create a safe space for vulnerability, openness, and deep listening through dialogue, allowing people an opportunity to enhance existing relationships and establish new ones through meaningful conversations that result in true transparency. The project was created using Adobe Illustrator. The colors used in creating the game aim to reflect the purpose and mood of each level, and the color palette is mainly pastel colors, evoking openness and relaxation so that players feel more comfortable opening up to one another.

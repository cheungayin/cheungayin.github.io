                <p>I was driven by the idea of the power of enhancement. Inspired by everyday objects and their ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, I explored this concept through my design of this book.</p>
                <p>This publication takes a closer look at the intricate connection of elements, showing how even those with less innate value on their own can enhance and elevate something else, eventually improving that “something else.”</p>
                <p>It is about the underlying relationships and the narratives, how each small, simple thing can develop and expand to become a part of an interesting story and add to a more vibrant whole. So a lot of things in our environment contributes to creating a narrative, enhancing an experience, and ultimately, making something better.</p>
                <p>Overview of key design decisions with their influences/inspirations:<br>
                    * form of publication: two books, one containing only text and the other images<br>
                    * no words are used in the book containing only images and vice versa<br>
                    * key design decisions, such as layout, typography, and visual elements, were meticulously chosen to amplify the message of enhancement<br>
                    * each decision was influenced by the very concept that drives this project<br>

            <p>This digital platform that explores of the relationship between different objects and the concept of enhancement. Each object plays a role in elevating and refining various aspect of our lives. Through a collection of carefully curated articles, this website strives to offer a comprehensive perspective on how each object, when harnessed thoughtfully and responsibly, contributes to the enhancement of the very essence of 'something else.'</p>
            <p>Overview of the type of content in online experience:<br>
                * covers all kinds of objects (including ones that were mentioned in the book + more)<br>
                * text from online articles (e.g. research papers, newspaper articles, books)<br>
                * images from both online sources and taken by myself<br>
                * a mix of text and images, each carefully curated to illustrate the concept of enhancement<br>
            </p>
            <p>How the design systems extends and connects to publication:
                <ul>Publication: 
                    <li>two books, one containing only text and the other images</li>
                    <li>no words are used in the book containing only images and vice versa</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Online experience:
                    <li>left column contains the title of each article</li>
                    <li>right column shows the content of each article, not visible at first when visiting the site</li>
                    <li>just text, color words and phrases are cues for people to click on them > images supporting the text will show up (e.g. Table 1, Fig. 1)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

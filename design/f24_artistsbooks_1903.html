Designed as an accordion book with fold-out sections, it keeps the original size of 35mm film to stay true to the medium while creating an engaging viewing experience. The layout allows readers to see the photos both individually and as a continuous sequence, with the film strips and fold-out images carefully sized to work together harmoniously. By presenting an unedited roll of film, the book captures authentic moments exactly as they were photographed, allowing viewers to follow the natural progression of time through the lens of the camera.<br><br>

                <p>Brief: <br>
                    Books are a time-based medium. You will begin to think about how a sequence of page spreads can demonstrate this idea. This first book project should address concepts of sequence, progression, and time, and the ways each element in a sequence are linked together. Think about how the book works together as a progression of moments, and how the physical details of the book work to accomplish this. Mediums and content should be chosen to best highlight these concepts. 
                    <br><br>
                    This can be, for example, a succession of different images that build upon each other. Or perhaps a single image that changes in some way each time the page turns. Think about the different kinds of sequences that you have read about in this class, and try to develop one of your own. You can use text or not; you can use representational imagery or not. What is important is that the book demonstrated the idea of a sequence that builds across the time spent with the book. 
                    <br><br>
                    You will design an original artist book using one variation of the pamphlet or the accordion structures; you can use foldouts, inner pamphlets sewn to concertina spines, or any other features as you desire. You should choose a structure which best suits the material you choose to communicate. What structure makes the most sense given the content you have chosen? How does the structure of your book support the sequence you are trying to develop?
                    <br><br>
                    Pay attention to craft. Think about how the book could be displayed and how it works as a three-dimensional object. Think about the covers of the book and how it invites the reader in. If you make an accordion, think about both sides of the accordion.</p>

We admired how the community accepted us with open arms and want to share all the culture and unique experiences coffee has to offer with everyone.\n\nOur goal is to make specialty coffee approachable. Every cup is crafted to be as palatable as it is aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on taste complemented by the delicacy of latte art.\n\nSwing by, grab a cup, and let us share our passion with you.",

       "description (from official websites)":"Serving organic, ethically sourced specialty coffee over friendly vibes — locally owned and community supported.\nCozy local coffee house offering specialty coffee & chill vibes.\n\nThroughout the years, we’ve seen gentrification take over. Many new businesses were displacing mom-and-pop Chinese stores with no acknowledgment of the existing community. Being with seniors every day, we saw how the places they regularly go to were closing and they were not welcome in the new ones. We wanted to create a place for the neighborhood, and offer products and services as “jook-sings” (Chinese born in a Western environment) to showcase how you can be modern yet still be a part of the local community. There is a clear cultural dichotomy between our elders and our American peers and we hope to bridge this gap with our small humble coffee shop.\n\nWe strive to cater to the neighborhood with Chinese-speaking staff and a Chinese menu. 90% of our customers live within a 2-3 block radius. This community has helped us get through this difficult year. We try to be inclusive of the older Chinese patrons by giving them senior discounts. Since our customers are mostly local, we also act as a bulletin board for the neighborhood and post Public Service Announcements like information about rent reduction.",

She is working on an opening plan and future opportunities for the Baxter St Cafe.\n\nTHINK Coffee is excited to come on as a supplier for the Baxter St Cafe, providing us with beans, pastries, supplies, and a helping hand to teach us the best techniques for brewing their coffee. THINK Coffee’s mission is to change how the world thinks about sourcing coffee responsibly. Each cup they sell directly benefits the most vulnerable in their supply chain.\n\nThe Baxter St Cafe is located in the Project Space. This adjacent space offers an expansion of our main gallery for exhibitions, events programming, and conversation series along with other relevant projects aimed to further amplify Baxter St at CCNY’s mission to uplift emerging lens-based artists and expand discourse around the surrounding mediums.

                <h2>Manifesto: Designer as Curious George (May 2024)</h2>
                <p>I created a motion graphic for Constantin and Laurene Leon Boym's "Manifesto #16: Designer as Curious George" from the design manifestos collection. This manifesto resonated with me because it uses the character Curious George to illustrate how designers should always be driven to play, experiment, and embrace failure as a learning experience.</p>

                <p>Inspired by Camille Utterback’s installations, in which she uses different texts, icons, images, etc., to create abstract symbolic systems, as well as our relationship with interfaces and symbolic systems of the machines, I recreated her installation, Visual Resolve, 2000, an abstracted version of the participants created on the screen, where she explores the levels of the icons and the overall image. This project connects to the <i>Magnification</i> project, and exploring how magnification can be experimented with and how it challenges our visual perception in a digital space.<br><br>

I aimed to align the visuals with the music, considering composition, sequence, and color palettes. Each student animated an assigned music segment and also created the opening title and closing credits for the class compilation using After Effects.</p>

                <p>This project explores how time-based presentation can transform a simple typographic message, examining the interplay between form and content in motion. By animating the headline of the article "Long Live the Chicago Rat Hole" from <i>The Atlantic</i>, I looked the effects of size, placement, composition, sound, speed, pauses, repetition, spacing, and color on the message over time. This project aims to reveal the dynamic potential of headlines through motion.</p>

                <p>This project investigates the microscope as an instrument of revelation, one that reveals the complexities of the invisible, how magnification embraces what is not apparent and reveals an intricate web of sophistication and elegance woven into even the smallest elements, where each magnified imagery turns the ordinary into something extraordinary. A digital form of the book is also created to explore the same concept and content but on a screen.</p>

                <p>This project (publication & website mockup) takes a closer look at the intricate connection of elements, showing how even those with less innate value on their own can enhance and elevate something else, eventually improving that “something else.” It is about the underlying relationships and the narratives, how each small, simple thing can develop and expand to become a part of an interesting story and add to a more vibrant whole. So a lot of things in our environment contributes to creating a narrative, enhancing an experience, and ultimately, making something better.</p>

                <p>(project 2. intx w/ data: Elastic Collection)<br>
                    Any time you see a multiplicity of an object, you begin to notice similarities and contexts in a new way. Seeing multiple of an object allows for this kind of in depth research that observing one object does not. The way the object is documented and organized helps direct the viewer on how the object is meant to be experienced.
                    <br><br>
                    This project investigates the themes of privacy through people-watching. The aim of this project is to gather and organize a collection of data, understand metadata, to tell a story through content curation and order, to experiment with interactions with a collection, and to develop a working relationship of JavaScript objects and data collections.
